# Functional_Programming-Scrapper

This is my first forey into functional programming. Background reasearch was heavily dependent on youtube for speakers and educators, 
then research on those professionals for their online content and books. Thus far the content is only backend without a UI. I plan to 
update the client side with a calendar UI. 

I am using the following core packages:

    1) Cheerio - Cheerio is a fast, lean implementation of core jQuery 
                 designed specifically for the server. 

        Why I'm using this: It makes DOM parsing very easy.
            
    2) Axios - Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

        Why I am using this: It will allow me to fetch page contents 
                                through HTTP requests.

    3) Express - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application 
                 framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

    4) Lodash - Lodash is a modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras. 

        Why I am using this: It makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle 
                                  out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
